# Big Cedar Lodge Day 1
## The Schmitt Invitational
The inaugural Schmitt Invitational took place in 2021 at the legendary Bandon Dunes. Just in time for the opening of Sheep Ranch and just before I jetted off to Europe for 6 months, it marked a return to normalcy after the surreality of 2020. 

In 2022 and 2023, we kept things local and played at Fox Chapel in Pittsburgh. 2024 marked another marquee event: Big Cedar Lodge in the Ozarks of Southwest Missouri. Despite being a leading voice behind the choice of venue, I went into the trip intentionally blind to the specifics of each course we'd play.

## Day 1: Mountain Top
We kicked off the trip with Gary Player's 13-hole course that occupies the highest ground of the resort's golf complex. The par-3 holes ranged in length from under 80 yards to over 220. I got off to a hot start with a birdie at the first hole with the entire group watching, but Ross had the shot of the trip on just the third hole. While my team teed off on the fourth, Wyatt turned back to watch the shots coming in on three. When he said "Oh go in!" I whipped my head around just in time to see Ross's ball catch the lip of the hole and fall in. It was the first time I witnessed an ace and was just Ross's second ever. 

The course winds along the top of the plateau, then up and down along the cliffside before wrapping back around the clubhouse and restaurant. In several spots, I felt like I was playing an oceanside course, with distant forests forming a dark horizon below an elevated green. In others, the limestone cliffs come into play for wayward shots. Ownership spared few expenses in intertwining the course and the natural surroundings. Several holes are linked by elevated rollercoaster walkways instead of plain paved walking paths. The clubhouse itself sits upon a rock outcropping behind the 13th green. The topography of the Ozarks is the focus at Mountain Top and rightly so.

We had a blast playing the course, even if the middle stretch challenged us. The 13th is a friendly homecoming hole and its central bowl was funneling good shots toward the cup. My dad nearly holed his shot while I filmed from the green, which was another highlight of the day. We capped the evening off with dinner, a putting contest, and a gorgeous sunset.
