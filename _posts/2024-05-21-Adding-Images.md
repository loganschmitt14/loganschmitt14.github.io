# Adding Images to a GitHub Pages Blog

I was a little bit lazy about learning to add images to this blog when I first created it. I'm using a template instead of writing the whole site from scratch, so I knew I couldn't just embed images with HTML. Turns out, it's still pretty simple. The main caveat is that Jekyll expects embedded assets to live in a `/docs/assets` directory. I put my pictures into subfolders within an `images` folder in that directory for organization purposes. We'll see if I ever need any other type of asset.
