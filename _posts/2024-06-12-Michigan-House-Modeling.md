### The Cabin (name pending)
My parents bought their retirement home in Northern Michigan last year. It's a cute little cabin on 10 acres of land. We as a family have fallen in love with the area after years of visiting and couldn't be happier to have a permanent home there. That said, the place is currently on the small side, with only 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, and an open loft. It sleeps 8+ people, but not comfortably. The plan is to have an addition built, which will add a main bedroom and bathroom. We'll also extend the current living room and add more windows to brighten the space.

My mother has so many ideas and concepts for the renovation that she's eager to explore. In order to hopefully save some time and money relaying these ideas to the architect, we're all going to take a stab at drawing up the renovations. Then I'll combine these ideas into a 3D model for us to evaluate. So, to start, I need a 3D model of the house as-is.

I turned to classic SketchUp for Web to do the modeling. We do have some paper drawings of the house, but they aren't totally faithul to the as-built structure. I took my own measurements and brought them into SketchUp. The house model doesn't need to have doors and windows at this point in time, it just needs to capture the essence of the structure.
