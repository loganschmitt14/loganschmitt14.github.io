I managed to extract the main jet after drilling out its center bore and using a tapered extraction bit. In doing so I drilled into the emulsion tube, which was annoying. Thankfully, most of the carburetor repair kits came with a main jet and multiple emulsion tubes, so it wasn't a big deal. 

I replaced the emulsion tube and main jet with the new parts and carefully reassembled the generator. I opened the fuel line valve and immediately saw gasoline spilling out of the bowl of the carb. I suspected the gaskets were probably too far gone to be reused but I had tried anyway. No matter, they could be replaced for a couple bucks too.

By the time I got back in town, the gaskets had shown up. I replaced every seal and gasket I could and rebuilt the generator again. This time, no leaks. It fired right up and ran smoothly. I read online to close the fuel line and let it run itself dry so it doesn't sit with a bunch of fuel in the carburetor. Hopefully that prevents the problem in the future.
