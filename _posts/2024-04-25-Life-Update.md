## Life Update
I spent about a week in Denver recently. I attended a wedding, caught up with friends and family, and generally had a really lovely time. I fleshed out some earlier posts while I was there but by and large didn't work on much from a technical standpoint (other than trying and failing to troubleshoot a JavaScript browser-based phone).

I returned late Tuesday 4/9 and woke up Wednesday to an exciting email. I received an invitation to apply for a lead data scientist role at a marketing agency. I know they use a lot of Bayesian and time series approaches so I spent the next couple of days diving back into Bayesian analysis and preparing for the first interview. It turned out to be a very casual conversation, and I left with a dataset and instructions to tell a story with it.

I spent far more time on the dataset than I initially anticipated. I applied some of the Bayesian analysis I learned, just to prove my hypothesis wrong. More specifically, I proved that I modeled my hypothesis poorly. But in any case, I wasn't generating an interesting narrative with that approach anyway so I switched gears. I ended up having fun with the project and presenting a slightly tongue-in-cheek finding. Hopefully my personality comes across well. I turned that project in on Tuesday the 23rd in time for a series of interviews on Wednesday. 

The interviews consisted of 4 30-minute conversations, which all went really well. They weren't especially technical, which was fine by me. I get the impression that being a good personality fit is crucial in the industry. Plus, I am confident I can quickly learn whatever data science minutae I need to pick up on the job. The final part of this step is a conversation with the VP of data science next Monday. I'm looking forward to it, but woke up today feeling really strange. Hopefully I'm not getting sick.

## What's Next?

* I haven't touched the Quantified Self or Putting Disk projects since getting home over 2 weeks ago because I've poured myself into this interview cycle. May is going to be incredibly busy for me even if I don't get this job, so I need to make some serious headway this coming week.

* I need to get my golf game in order. The father-son golf trip happens in exactly 2 weeks and my short game needs serious work.

* I need to clean out the garage. I'll write a post about it, but we went to an estate sale and came away with a ton of stuff, lots of which needs some attention before I can put it away.

* I need to make progress on the Michigan House renderings so we can explore potential renovations.

* Along the same lines, I need to work with dad on deciding the features and footprint of the golf shed in Michigan. Ideally we get the structure built this summer.
