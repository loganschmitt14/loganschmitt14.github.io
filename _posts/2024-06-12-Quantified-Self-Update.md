# Quantified Self Update
## Or Lack Thereof

I guess it's fitting that I made the first Quantified Self post on April Fools' Day. I've done a lot of thinking about the project since then, but haven't tracked a single metric or written a line of code. I have two big hangups that are holding me back from starting: wearables and routine.

### Wearables
 I lack a wearable tracking device, which means I have no means of collecting a major portion of the data for this project. I haven't found many wearables that meet all my needs:
 * I don't want to switch to a fitness watch and ditch my watch collection.
 * I don't want to pay a subscription
 * I want to easily move my data from the device to my own data warehouse

 ### Routine
I also don't have any form of routine these days. I know it isn't optimal but I'm going to sleep and waking up at a different time every day. I typically get in a pretty solid routine when I have a job, so that should be changing soon. That said, I know myself well enough to know that I'll have a really tough time self-policing my sleep schedule for the sole purpose of this experiment.

### Next Steps
I'm going to leave this idea on the backburner as I'm still really interested in the results. Once I have a routine and my own place, I'll be far better equipped to run this experiment properly.
