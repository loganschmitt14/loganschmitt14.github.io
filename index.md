## I'm Logan ##

I often struggle with the "tell me about yourself" question. My interests pull me in a thousand different directions while my perfectionism holds me back. The former is incredibly important to me &mdash; my interests and hobbies are what give me life. The perfectionism, I could do without. But the perfectionism is also integral to who I am, how I think, and my journey thus far.

### Why the Blog?

There are several reasons for me to keep a blog. I want a unified place to share my interests. I don't want to participate in the dopamine economy of posting on social media, at least as a self-representing individual. This blog can serve as a portfolio for multidisciplinary projects, with levels of detail that exceed a typical Readme file on GitHub.
