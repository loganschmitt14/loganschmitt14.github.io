Welcome. I'm Logan.

## Why the Blog?

There are several reasons for me to keep a blog. I want a unified place to share my interests. I don't want to participate in the dopamine economy of posting on social media, at least as a self-representing individual. This blog can serve as a portfolio for multidisciplinary projects, with levels of detail that exceed a typical Readme file on GitHub.


I want this blog to strike the right balance between structured and scattered. I want to give a good idea of my thought processes when I take on a project without turning each entry into an academic paper. I want the blog to be both a driving force of my creative processes and a living document of those processes.


## About Me

> *This section will be moved to its own post at some point, but for now it can hang out on the homepage.*

I often struggle with the "tell me about yourself" question. My interests pull me in a thousand different directions while my perfectionism holds me back. The former is incredibly important to me &mdash; my interests and hobbies are what give me life. The perfectionism, I could do without. But the perfectionism is also integral to who I am, how I think, and my journey thus far.

So how should I describe myself? Generally speaking, I'm someone who spends more time thinking than doing. At least when it comes to technical tasks. It's something I'm working on. I love to learn and connect concepts, but I also strive for mastery, meaning I **love** to do things "correctly". This is where the perfectionism and overthinking collide, and it's one of the main reasons I started this blog. I want to show myself that getting started and learning along the way is a better path than trying to optimize an outcome in my mind from the start. It's okay to bodge something together and iterate on it later if need be.

### Education and Work Experience
I've always said that if someone would pay me to go to school, I'd take that job in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I haven't found that gig yet, but I have been to plenty of school anyway. I graduated from Colorado School of Mines in 2019 with a degree in mechanical engineering. I more recently spent the entirety of 2023 learning data science from an online platform called Springboard. I'd like to think I'm done with formal schooling for a while.


### Hobbies and Interests

#### Pottery
I picked up ceramics in high school and recently rediscovered my passion for clay. After only handbuilding pots in school, I learned to throw on the wheel in 2023 and have found the whole process incredibly addictive. It's simultaneously challenging and soothing. Clay can always be recycled so I feel more liberated to push myself when I'm throwing something. I can fail without consequence, which I think is good practice for me. I have a small pottery studio and intend to document my pottery here on this blog quite thoroughly.

#### Golf

I could spend dozens of paragraphs describing my relationship with the game of golf. Like so many other golfers, I absolutely love and hate the game. I'll never be as good at golf as I want to be. I'll never even be as good as I can be. But I'll also never quit trying to improve. I have many goals within the game that I'm aiming to accomplish, and I'll chronicle those here.
