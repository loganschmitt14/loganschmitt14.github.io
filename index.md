Welcome. I'm Logan.

## Why the Blog?

There are several reasons for me to keep a blog. I want a unified place to share my interests. I don't want to participate in the dopamine economy of posting on social media, at least as a self-representing individual. This blog can serve as a portfolio for multidisciplinary projects, with levels of detail that exceed a typical Readme file on GitHub.


I want this blog to strike the right balance between structured and scattered. I want to give a good idea of my thought processes when I take on a project without turning each entry into an academic paper. I want the blog to be both a driving force of my creative processes and a living document of those processes.


## About Me

> *This section will be moved to its own post at some point, but for now it can hang out on the homepage.*

I often struggle with the "tell me about yourself" question. My interests pull me in a thousand different directions while my perfectionism holds me back. The former is incredibly important to me &mdash; my interests and hobbies are what give me life. The perfectionism, I could do without. But the perfectionism is also integral to who I am, how I think, and my journey thus far.

So how should I describe myself? Generally speaking, I'm someone who spends more time thinking than doing. At least when it comes to technical tasks. It's something I'm working on. I love to learn and connect concepts, but I also strive for mastery, meaning I **love** to do things "correctly". This is where the perfectionism and overthinking collide, and it's one of the main reasons I started this blog. I want to show myself that getting started and learning along the way is a better path than trying to optimize an outcome in my mind from the start. It's okay to bodge something together and iterate on it later if need be.

### Education and Work Experience

#### School

I've always said that if someone would pay me to go to school, I'd take that job in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I haven't found that gig yet, but I have been to plenty of school anyway. I graduated from Colorado School of Mines in 2019 with a degree in mechanical engineering. I more recently spent the entirety of 2023 learning data science from an online platform called Springboard. I'd like to think I'm done with formal schooling for a while &mdash; at least that I'm willing to pay for.

#### Work Experience

My first engineering job was an internship at a small firm called Display Devices, Inc. (DDI) in Golden, Colorado. In the interest of full disclosure, I will mention that my uncle worked at the same firm and introduced me to the owner. DDI specializes in custom AV solutions that few others can (or will) take on. These projects include submersible projector enclosures, outdoor touchscreen kiosks, and moving video walls. My internship took place after my junior year of college, in the summer of 2018. I mostly worked on SolidWorks models for sheet metal enclosures, projector mounts, and 3D printed fixtures. My supervisor was the lead designer on a new touchscreen kiosk, so I got to know the product quite well that summer.

The following summer, I sought out something new. I was one of three interns at a firm in Boulder. We focused on the firm's pilot plant in Missouri, which used a series of pyrolysis chambers to recycle used tires into carbon black. The process also generated a number of byproducts: steel wire that was mechanically separated from the rubber, heavy oil that was sold for refining, and syngas that was fed back into the reactor as fuel. I did a variety of intern tasks that summer, but my proudest accomplishment was automating the daily factory report email. Each day, the factory reporting software pushed an updated data stream to a spreadsheet. I wrote an Excel VBA script to consolidate this data into a small report and send it as an email to the team. In hindsight, I'm quite amazed that I actually completed a coding task without ChatGPT. Nevermind that I could probably do the whole thing in a day now.

That internship ended in August 2019, at which point I was quite content to take a couple months for myself. I hadn't just existed without work or school obligations since May of 2015, so I decided to give myself some time before aggressively pursuing a job. In early October, I got a call from my supervisor at DDI. The aforementioned kiosk project had really taken off and needed more support. He asked if I wanted to come help out on a part-time basis, mainly as a travelling installer. I loved the idea of travelling for work, so I took him up on it.

By January 2020, I was working full-time at DDI. I was travelling to Cleveland with some frequency to handle the installation and rollout of a new product. I was also learning how to install and troubleshoot the touchscreen kiosks, on top of some new design work. I didn't realize at the time how lucky I was to end up employed just before the pandemic hit. I don't know what would have happened if I still hadn't found a job by March of 2020.




### Hobbies and Interests

#### Pottery
I picked up ceramics in high school and recently rediscovered my passion for clay. After only handbuilding pots in school, I learned to throw on the wheel in 2023 and have found the whole process incredibly addictive. It's simultaneously challenging and soothing. Clay can always be recycled so I feel more liberated to push myself when I'm throwing something. I can fail without consequence, which I think is good practice for me. I have a small pottery studio and intend to document my pottery here on this blog quite thoroughly.

#### Golf

I could spend dozens of paragraphs describing my relationship with the game of golf. Like so many other golfers, I absolutely love and hate the game. I'll never be as good at golf as I want to be. I'll never even be as good as I can be. But I'll also never quit trying to improve. I have many goals within the game that I'm aiming to accomplish, and I'll chronicle those here.

#### Biking

I loved being on my bike as a kid, but after having my bike stolen in college, I lost interest for several years. I was finally convinced to try real mountain biking in Colorado in the summer of 2020. It hooked me right away, even though my first time was both terrifying and exhausting. I bought a full suspension bike in September of that year.
